## Overview

This project focuses on predicting the prices of avocados using various regression algorithms. The dataset was sourced from Kaggle and includes relevant features to facilitate the prediction process.

## Features

- Utilizes various regression algorithms for avocado price prediction.
- Dataset collected from Kaggle, containing information about avocado prices and characteristics.

## Algorithms Used

- Linear Regression
- Decision Trees
- Random Forest
- Support Vector Regression (SVR)
- Gradient Boosting

## Dataset

The dataset used in this project is sourced from Kaggle and includes information about avocado prices, types, and characteristics. It contains features such as average price, total volume, type, region, etc.

## Project Structure

- `data/`: Contains the dataset files.
- `notebooks/`: Jupyter notebooks with the code for data exploration, preprocessing, and model training.
- `src/`: Python source code for the project.
- `requirements.txt`: List of dependencies needed to run the project.

## How to Run

1. Install dependencies using `pip install -r requirements.txt`.
2. Execute the notebooks in the `notebooks/` folder in the given order.
3. Run the scripts in the `src/` folder for further analysis or model training.

## Results

Include a summary of the performance of each regression algorithm and any insights gained from the analysis.

## Future Work

- Discuss potential improvements to the model.
- Suggestions for additional features or algorithms that could enhance performance.
