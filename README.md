## Future Work

- 
## Conclusion

- Clearly, we can see that the accuracies of the algorithms 1 and 6 are the highest.
- Also we can see from the chart of rmse that the rmse of algorithm 1 is lower as compared to that of algorithm 6.
- Thus we conclude that algorithm 6 i.e. AdaBoostRegressor has performed well in the given dataset.
